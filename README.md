## Quick Start with Agent Examples

### Localhost

#### Step ⓵ - Prerequisites

| Category | Requirements |
| --- | --- |
| **Keys** | • Agora [App ID][agora-app-id] and [App Certificate][agora-app-certificate]<br>• [OpenAI][openai-api] API key<br>• [Deepgram][deepgram] ASR <br>• [ElevenLabs][elevenlabs] TTS  |
| **Installation** | • [Docker][docker] / [Docker Compose][docker-compose]<br>• [Node.js (LTS) v18][nodejs] |
| **Minimum System Requirements** | • CPU >= 2 cores<br>• RAM >= 4 GB |

<br>

![divider][divider-light]
![divider][divider-dark]

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> **macOS: Docker setting on Apple Silicon**
>
> Uncheck "Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation" in Docker settings, it may result in slower build times on ARM, but performance will be normal when deployed to x64 servers. -->

#### Step ⓶ - Build agent examples in VM

##### 1. Clone the repo, `cd` into `ai_agents`, and create a `.env` file from `.env.example`

```bash
cd ai_agents
cp ./.env.example ./.env
```

##### 2. Set up the Agora App ID and App Certificate in `.env`

```bash
AGORA_APP_ID=
AGORA_APP_CERTIFICATE=

# Deepgram (required for speech-to-text)
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=

# OpenAI (required for language model)
OPENAI_API_KEY=

# ElevenLabs (required for text-to-speech)
ELEVENLABS_TTS_KEY=
```

##### 3. Start agent development containers

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

##### 4. Enter the container

```bash
docker exec -it ten_agent_dev bash
```

##### 5. Build the agent with the default example (~5-8 min)

Check the `agents/examples` folder for additional samples.
Start with one of these defaults:

```bash
# use the chained voice assistant
cd agents/examples/voice-assistant

# or use the speech-to-speech voice assistant in real time
cd agents/examples/voice-assistant-realtime
```

##### 6. Start the web server

Run `task build` if you changed any local source code. This step is required for compiled languages (for example, TypeScript or Go) and not needed for Python.

```bash
task install
task run
```

##### 7. Access the agent

Once the agent example is running, you can access the following interfaces:

| **localhost:49483** | **localhost:3000** |
| :-----------------: | :----------------: |
| ![Screenshot 1][localhost-49483-image] | ![Screenshot 2][localhost-3000-image] |

- TMAN Designer: [localhost:49483][localhost-49483]
- Agent Examples UI: [localhost:3000][localhost-3000]

<br>

![divider][divider-light]
![divider][divider-dark]

#### Step ⓷ - Customize your agent example

1. Open [localhost:49483][localhost-49483].
2. Right-click the STT, LLM, and TTS extensions.
3. Open their properties and enter the corresponding API keys.
4. Submit your changes, now you can see the updated Agent Example in [localhost:3000][localhost-3000].

<br>

<br>

#### Run a transcriber app from TEN Manager without Docker (Beta)

TEN also provides a transcriber app that you can run from TEN Manager without using Docker.

Check the [quick start guide][quick-start-guide-ten-manager] for more details.

<br>

![divider][divider-light]
![divider][divider-dark]

<br>

### Codespaces

GitHub offers free Codespaces for each repository. You can run Agent Examples in Codespaces without using Docker. Codespaces typically start faster than local Docker environments.

[![][codespaces-shield]][codespaces-new]

Check out [this guide][codespaces-guide] for more details.

## Agent Examples Self-Hosting

### Deploying with Docker

Once you have customized your agent (either by using the TMAN Designer or editing `property.json` directly), you can deploy it by creating a release Docker image for your service.

##### Release as Docker image

**Note**: The following commands need to be executed outside of any Docker container.

###### Build image

```bash
cd ai_agents
docker build -f agents/examples/<example-name>/Dockerfile -t example-app .
```

###### Run

```bash
docker run --rm -it --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 example-app
```

<br>

![divider][divider-light]
![divider][divider-dark]

### Deploying with other cloud services

You can split the deployment into two pieces when you want to host TEN on providers such as [Vercel][vercel] or [Netlify][netlify].

1. Run the TEN backend on any container-friendly platform (a VM with Docker, Fly.io, Render, ECS, Cloud Run, or similar). Use the example Docker image without modifying it and expose port `8080` from that service.

2. Deploy only the frontend to Vercel or Netlify. Point the project root to `ai_agents/agents/examples/<example>/frontend`, run `pnpm install` (or `bun install`) followed by `pnpm build` (or `bun run build`), and keep the default `.next` output directory.

3. Configure environment variables in your hosting dashboard so that `AGENT_SERVER_URL` points to the backend URL, and add any `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` keys the UI needs (for example, Agora credentials you surface to the browser).

4. Ensure your backend accepts requests from the frontend origin — via open CORS or by using the built-in proxy middleware.

With this setup, the backend handles long-running worker processes, while the hosted frontend simply forwards API traffic to it.
